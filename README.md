## Description of the Triangle Tracker program
<p>I built an application that helps us know whether a triangle is isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NOT a triangle at all.
Some point to note are:
<ol>
<li>For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal.</li>
<li>For an isosceles triangle, two sides are exactly equal.</li>
<li>For a scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal. However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.</li>
<li>If the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values.</li></p>
</ol>
<p>Technologies used include:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTM</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
