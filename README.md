## Description of the Triangle Tracker program
<p>I built an application that helps us know whether a triangle is isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NOT a triangle at all.
Some points to note are:
<ol>
<li>For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal.</li>
<li>For an isosceles triangle, two sides are exactly equal.</li>
<li>For a scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal. However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.</li>
<li>If the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values.</li></p>
</ol>

|-------------------            | :---------------------------------------:  |------------------------------:|
|The program determines whether |length-1 (12)                               |This is an equilateral triangle|
the three sides  are equal to an|length-2 (12)
equilateral triangle            |length-3 (12)
|The program determines whether |length-1 (10)                               |This is an isosceles triangle  |  
the three sides are equal to an |length-2 (10)
isosceles triangle              |length-3 (13)
|The program determines whether |length-1 (9)                                |This is a scalene triangle     |
the three sides are equal to an |length-2 (10)
scalene triangle                |length-3 (11)
|Not a triangle                 |length-1 (9)                                |This cannot form a triangle    |
                                |length-2 (4)
                                |length-3 (3)
